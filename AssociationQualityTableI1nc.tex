\caption[Cut values for the distance between track and vertex in iteration one. Based on these classese the quality of iteration two is defined]{The cut values in \cm for the distance between track and associated primary vertex for the different steps in iteration one. Tracks with a first association with a smaller distance are categorized in the next iteration into two different qualities classes. An exception are tracks which were association using secondary vertices in the first iteration. These tracks are always categorized into two quality classes depending on the distances of the first and of the second association.}
