\caption[Cut values for the distance between track and vertex to divide the associations from iteration 1 into two groups on which the qualities of the associations created in iteration 2 are defined.]{The cut values in cm for the distance between track and associated primary vertex for the different steps in iteration 1. Tracks with association 1 with a smaller distance are categorized in the next iteration into quality class 1, all others in class 2. An exception are tracks which are associated using secondary vertices in iteration 1. These tracks are always categorized into two quality classes depending on the distances of association 1 and 2.}
