\begin{table}[h]

\caption{The cut values in cm for the distance between track and associated primary vertex for the different steps in iteration one. Tracks with a first association with a smaller distance are categorized in the next iteration into quality class 1, all others in class 2. An exception are tracks which are associated using secondary vertices in the first iteration. These tracks are always categorized into two quality classes depending on the distances of the first and second association.}
