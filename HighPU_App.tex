\chapter{Results for high Pileup Scenarios \label{sec:HPUApp}}

In the following the results are shown for the track association and the jet reconstruction for event with a high number of pileup interactions. Information of the conditions of the simulation can be found in Chapter~\ref{sec:HPU}. The definitions of the various parameter can be found in Sections~\ref{sec:TrackAss} and~\ref{sec:OOJetsPtResponse}.

\section{\texorpdfstring{13\TeV{}}{13 TeV} and \texorpdfstring{$\left<PU\right>=30$}{<PU>=30}}

In this study the center-of-mass energy is set to 13\TeV{} while the average number of pileup interaction is 30. 

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\MET{}}{MET} Reconstruction  \label{sec:HPUAppE13PU30MC}}

\section{\texorpdfstring{13\TeV{}}{13 TeV} and \texorpdfstring{$\left<PU\right>=50$}{<PU>=50}}

In this study the center-of-mass energy is set to 13\TeV{} while the average number of pileup interaction is 50. 

\subsection{Track Association \label{sec:HPUAppE13PU50TA}}

The general performance of the different qualities is similar to those presented in Section~\ref{sec:HPUTA} and much worse compared to the results shown in Chapter~\ref{sec:TrackAss}. Hence, the explanations and conclusions given earlier are also valid here. Doing no pileup subtraction leads to the best results.

\subsubsection{$\Zz\rightarrow\MM$}

Based on 25\,000 simulated $\Zz\rightarrow\MM$ events the different association qualities are compared. Furthermore, the default configuration of the association map is compared to the other pileup subtraction techniques.
