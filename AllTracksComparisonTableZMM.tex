\caption[Comparison of the signal and pileup efficiency and purity for the different pileup subtraction techniques based on \Zz to \MM events]{The resulting values in $\%$ for efficiency, purity and the product of both for keeping signal tracks and subtracting pileup tracks for the different pileup subtraction techniques. Here, all tracks from simulated \Zz to \MM events were considered. All values are averaged over the whole parameter range. This study is based on 25000 events with on average about 450 tracks including 56 signal tracks per event.}
