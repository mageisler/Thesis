\chapter{Introduction \label{sec:Intro}}

\lettrine[lines=2]{T}{\,}he current assumption of the nature of elementary particles and their interactions is described by a handful of principles. These principles design the Standard Model of Particle Physics (SM). In it the particles are group by their angular momentum called spin. All particles with half-integer values are named Fermions and can be associated with matter. These are then further categorized by their participatoin to the strong force into leptons and quarks. Up to now, the latter have not been seen individual but in bounded states like Mesons (two qurks) or Baryon (three quarks). All particles with an integer spin value are named Bosons. They can be either elementary or composite partilces like the mentioned Mesons. Elementary bosons are mostly force carrier. As there are the propagator of the strong force, the gluons and those of the electro-weak-force, namely $\gamma{}$, \Zz{} and \Wpm{}. Recently, a long searched Boson has been detected, the Higgs-Boson. The purpose of the connected Higgs-field is to give mass to all elementary particles. Mathematically, the unification of the electromagnetic and weak interaction can be described by a $\textrm{SU(2)}_{\textrm{L}} \times \textrm{U(1)}_{\textrm{Y}}$-group by the Glashow-Salam-Weinberg theory. The strong interaction can be described by the Quantumchromodynamic in a $\textrm{SU(3)}_{\textrm{C}}$-group. An overview of the particles is shown in Figure~\ref{plot:IntroParticles}.

For each particle the mass in \MeVcc (upper left corner), the electromagnetic charge in multiples of the positron charge e (bottom left corner) and the spin (bottom right corner) is listed. The fermions are further split into Quarks and Leptons. For the neutrinos the upper bounds of the masses are given. The particles in dark colored boxed participate in the strong force. All valus are taken from~\citen{Beringer:1900zz}. \label{plot:IntroParticles} }

Describing only about $5\,\%$ of the actual composition of the universe the Standard Model as it now gives a lot of answers while some questions are still open. For instance, about the actual number of lepton families, the hierachy problem and the grand unification of all forces. To address the last two issues a theoretical expansion of the Standard Model has been created. In the scenario of a Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) every SM-particle would obtain a supersymmetric partner with different spin. In theory, the lightest of these new supersymmetric particles could be a candidate for Dark Matter. This could open the door to about $25\,\%$ of the composition of the universe. But, up to now no sign or hint for this theory has been observed. \\

Nowadays, lots of different experiments try to test the predicitions of the Standard Model at different frontiers. One of the largest and well-known experiment is located at CERN  close to Geneva in Switzerland. The proton proton collider Large Hadron Collider (LHC) located there is the world largest accelerator reaching also the highest energies. Together with the four main detetectors it started operation at the end of 2010 and is currently in a long shutdown. After this shutdown the energy of the protons will be higher so that new physics is in reach and the mentioned MSSM can be more investigated. \\

In Chapter~\ref{sec:LHCCMS} more information about the properties of the LHC as well as of one of the main detectors, the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) will be presented. The presented work is based on the framework of this experiment. Hence, a brief description about the structure of the detector and the event reconstruction is shown. Furthermore, some key facts about the actual number of proton-proton interactions in one bunch crossing are discussed. Connected with this number are the unavoidable background interactions and their influence on the reconstruction.

\paragraph*{Natural Units}

In the work presented in this thesis natural units are partially used. These is commonly used in high energy physics equalizing $\hbar{} = c = 1$. This has as a consequence that energy, momentum and masses have the same dimension. Only if explicitely denoted SI units are used (for instance, to keep clearness at distances).
