\caption[Comparison of the signal and pileup efficiency and purity for the different pileup subtraction techniques for electrons only based on \Zz to \EE events]{The resulting values in $\%$ for efficiency, purity and the product of both for keeping signal tracks and subtracting pileup tracks for the different pileup subtraction techniques. Here, only electrons from simulated \Zz to \EE events were considered. All values are averaged over the whole parameter range. This study is based on 9000 events with on average slightly above 2 tracks including 2 signal tracks per event.}
