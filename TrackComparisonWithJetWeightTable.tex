\caption[Efficiencies, purities and the product of both of the different pileup subtraction techniques with a jet weight applied on each track]{The values of efficiency, purity and the product of both  in $\%$ for preserving signal tracks and subtracting pileup tracks for the different pileup subtraction techniques. Here, all tracks from simulated \ttbar events are considered. Additionally, the tracks are weighted according to their contribution to the jet momentum (see Equation~\eqnref{eq:OOJetWeight}). All values are averaged over the whole parameter range. }
